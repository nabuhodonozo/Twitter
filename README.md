# Twitter

My first bigger project. I tried to make basic Twitter functionality during Coderslab bootcamp. It's not finished yet. I switched my energy and atention to my other project [GroupTasker](https://github.com/nabuhodonozo/groupTasker) with similar functionalities.


Functionalities:
- Login authentication
- Validation of user input data
- User registration 
- Adding Tweets
        
Technologies used:
* [Java8]()
* [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
 * [Spring MVC]()
 * [Spring JPA]()
* [Hibernate]()
* [MySQL]()
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
